## Sorting Suite

### About

Sorting algorithms are one of the common domains for studying computer science data structures and algorithms.  This repo explores an implementation of three fundamental sorting algorithms written in JavaScript and tested with Mocha. 

The three algorithms I implemented are:
1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Merge sort
